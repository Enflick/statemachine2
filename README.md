State Machine Management:

Define and manage state machines with unique names and IDs.
Set the initial state for a state machine.
Add custom handlers to a state machine.
Execution Control:

Execute state machine handlers in a specific order.
Support forward and backward movement through the state machine.
Pause and resume execution of a state machine.
Control whether to execute the next step immediately.
Database Integration:

Store and retrieve state machines and their states in a MySQL database.
Create tables for each state machine type if they don't exist.
Insert and update state machines in the database.
Query state machines by type.
Kafka Integration:

Send Kafka events for state changes if configured.
Locking Mechanism:

Implement locking for state machines based on global and local configurations.
Ensure only one state machine is processed at a time per user/account.
Serialization:

Serialize and deserialize state machines for storage and resumption.
Error Handling:

Handle errors gracefully during execution and database interactions.
Transition History:

Maintain a history of executed transitions with details on handler names, initial and modified states, and arbitrary data.
Arbitrary Data:

Support the storage and propagation of arbitrary data across handlers and transitions.
Readme Documentation:

Provide clear usage examples and instructions in a readme.md file.



Global Lock:

A global lock is a mechanism that ensures exclusive access to a shared resource or operation across all state machines, regardless of their types or users/accounts.
When a state machine is configured with a global lock, it means that only one state machine can be processed at a time across the entire system.
This lock is typically used for critical operations or resources that should not be accessed concurrently by multiple state machines, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Local Lock:

A local lock is a mechanism that ensures exclusive access to a shared resource or operation within a specific type of state machine or for a specific user/account.
When a state machine is configured with a local lock, it means that only one state machine of the same type (state machine name) or for the same user/account can be processed at a time.
This lock is useful when you want to prevent concurrent execution of state machines of the same type or for the same user/account, ensuring order and preventing conflicts.



State Machine Table (for tracking state machines):

ID: Primary key, unique identifier for each state machine instance.
Name: The name or type of the state machine.
UserID: User or account identifier associated with the state machine.
CurrentState: Current state of the state machine.
Direction: Direction of movement (forward, backward).
ResumeFromStep: The step to resume from when recreated.
SaveAfterStep: Flag to indicate whether to save after each step.
KafkaEventTopic: Kafka topic for events (nullable if not used).
SerializedState: JSON serialized state data (to store arbitrary data).
CreatedTimestamp: Timestamp when the state machine was created.
UpdatedTimestamp: Timestamp when the state machine was last updated.
IsGlobalLock: Flag to indicate if the state machine has a global lock.
IsLocalLock: Flag to indicate if the state machine has a local lock.
Any other columns specific to your requirements.
The ID field should be unique for each state machine, and you can use it as the primary key. The Name field helps identify the type of state machine. The UserID field associates state machines with users or accounts.

Global Lock Table (for tracking global locks):

ID: Primary key, unique identifier for each global lock instance.
StateMachineID: Foreign key referencing the state machine with a global lock.
LockTimestamp: Timestamp when the global lock was acquired.
The ID field should be unique for each global lock instance, and you can use it as the primary key. The StateMachineID field is a foreign key linking the global lock to the state machine it's associated with. The LockTimestamp field helps track when the lock was acquired.
